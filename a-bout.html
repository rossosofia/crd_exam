        <h2>THE BASICS OF ROLLER DERBY</h2>
        <p>
          Roller derby involves two teams skating around a track. Each team has one jammer aiming to pass opponents to score points, while blockers work to stop the opposing jammer. A match consist of two two 30-minute periods, split into shorter
          segments called jams, each lasting a maximum of 2 minutes.
