            <p>
              Actually, roller derby doesn't have a ball. The whole game
              revolves around skaters racing around a track. Players earn points
              by skillfully passing opponents during the action-packed bouts.

        <h2>THE BASICS OF ROLLER DERBY</h2>
        <p>
          Roller derby involves two teams skating around a track. Each team has
          one jammer aiming to pass opponents to score points, while blockers
          work to stop the opposing jammer. A match consist of two two 30-minute
          periods, split into shorter segments called jams, each lasting a
          maximum of 2 minutes.
