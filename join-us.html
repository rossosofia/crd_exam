            We encourage everyone over 18, regardless of skill level and gender to come try this amazing sport for themselves! - and yes, you can join, even if you cannot roller skate at all at this point! If you are under 18, you can join our

          <h2>WHAT TO BRING</h2>
          <p>
            Quad Roller Skates, comfortable sports clothes and a water bottle. You must wear knee pads and elbow pads, wristguards and a helmet (skater). We do have some Roller Derby skates and gear that you can borrow, but we can't promise that we
            will have enough for everyone. Therefore, we recommend you buy some skates. it's important that the skates don't have a heel (i.e. jam skates). Basic quad skates for Roller Derby or park skating will be fine to start with. If you stick
            with it, you'll likely upgrade your skates after about a year. Affordable starter Roller Derby skates are Riedell R3, Bont Quadstar, or Chaya Ruby. It can be difficult to source Roller Derby skates in Denmark unfortunately, but you can
            buy them easily online in Europe via: suckerpunchskateshop.com, stickyskates.se, and rollerderbyhouse.eu Helmets, elbow pads, wrist guards, knee pads and mouth guards can be purchased in Copenhagen at Mills

              <h3>Where is the ball?</h3>
              <p>Actually, roller derby doesn't have a ball. The whole game revolves around skaters racing around a track. Players earn points by skillfully passing opponents during the action-packed bouts.</p>
