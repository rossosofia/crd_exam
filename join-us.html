          <h2>WHO CAN JOIN?</h2>
          <p>
            We encourage everyone over 18, regardless of skill level and gender
            to come try this amazing sport for themselves! - and yes, you can
            join, even if you cannot roller skate at all at this point! If you
            are under 18, you can join our juniors.

          <h2>WHAT TO BRING</h2>
          <p>
            Quad Roller Skates, comfortable sports clothes and a water bottle.
            You must wear knee pads and elbow pads, wristguards and a helmet
            (skater). We do have some Roller Derby skates and gear that you can
            borrow, but we can't promise that we will have enough for everyone.
            Therefore, we recommend you buy some skates. Basic quad skates for
            Roller Derby or park skating will be fine to start with.

              <h3>Where is the ball?</h3>
              <p>
                Actually, roller derby doesn't have a ball. The whole game
                revolves around skaters racing around a track. Players earn
                points by skillfully passing opponents during the action-packed
                bouts.
